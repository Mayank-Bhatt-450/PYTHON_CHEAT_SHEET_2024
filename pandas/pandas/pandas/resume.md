* **Served as the primary contact for Blackstoneâ€™s transmissions team with the 15+ banks.**
* **During my tenure at Blackstone, I designed, developed, and deployed 41 micro services, with 32 currently in production. Additionally, I created 10 Snowflake views and 5 Fivetran connectors with Oracle DB.
* **Managed critical projects with tight deadlines, ensuring high code quality and timely releases to expedite payment processes.
* 
* 
* Identified a bottleneck in Account Statement Data Extraction and implemented a hashing solution to avoid reprocessing files. Developed a block text extraction algorithm, was six times more cost-effective than the Key-Value extraction method in Textract,resulting in annual savings of $80,000."
